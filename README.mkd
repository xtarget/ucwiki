µcwiki
======

µcwiki is a tiny and static C wiki engine. Meant to be as simple as possible.
We just give a directory path as input, and the µcwiki transforms markup
files into nice html pages powered with bootstrap.

Notice
------

**I'm currently on very early development phase.**

	Usage: ucwiki [OPTIONS]
